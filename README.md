Chill's Blacksmithing
Our client, Collin Hill, is a beginner blacksmith who needed a way to reach out to people online with his services. He asked us to create a website that provides information about him, photos of his finished products, and business contact information. 
We chose to start the home page with a simple introductory video showing potential clients what Collin does. After viewing the homepage, visitors can easily navigate the sticky header at the top of the screen to view the five pages on the website: the about me page, a FAQ page, a photos page, a map page, and a contacts page. The client wanted the pages to be simplistic in design and easy to read, so that was our goal. For our color scheme, we went with red, orange, yellow, and black. These colours would be found in a blacksmith forge, so we and the client believed that it would fit the theme quite well. 
Now Collin Smith Blacksmithing has a website and Mr. Hill is excited about this opportunity to grow his business.
